# Final Programming Project #
## Goal: ##
_Create a Java program using topics from the entire course to demonstrate knowledge and mastery._
## Requirements: ##
1. All Unit Deliverables must be tied to a real-world topic:
    - Should be linked to an article, podcast, video, etc.
**OR** 
    - A personal idea for something that is useful/fun for you, your community, etc.
2. Your project must use materials from, **and restricted to**, topics we've covered so far. Specifically: 
-  Must include at least 1 programmer-defined class for each team member, in addition to the `Main` class.
    - [ ] each class definition must have at least 3 instance variables representing two or more datatypes (`String`, `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`).
    - [ ] each class definition must have **all** of our required methods for encapsulation:
  	  - [ ] no-argument (a.k.a. default) constructor method
  	  - [ ] full constructor method
      - [ ] copy constructor - NOTE: This was not required for UD 3 so be sure to add it in if reusing.
  	  - [ ] accesssor/getter and mutator/setter methods for each instance variable
  	  - [ ] `setAll` method
  	  - [ ] `toString` method
  	  - [ ] `equals` method
    - [ ] you *may* add any additional methods, static or non-static, that are useful to your project, the above is just the mininum
-  Must have a driver class (`Main`) that:
    - [ ] Must use objects of each of your class types in a meaningful way
    - [ ] Must include at least one array (either single or multi-dimensional array is fine) per team member
    - [ ] Must include at least one conditional (if/else, switch) statement per team member
    - [ ] Must include at least one loop (while, for, or do-while are all fine) per team member
    - [ ] May use the `UtilityBelt` class (provided) to collect user input or you may create your own Scanner object
  
## Resources: ##
- OLI Modules + Lecture Videos for examples, Java syntax rules, and strategy
- Labs for larger examples, getting inspiration or ideas
- You are allowed to expand on your Unit 1, Unit 2, or Unit 3 Programming Project as well!

## Scoring Guide: ##
All group members might not recieve the same score. Be sure to indicate which parts of the project you contributed. You may also be asked to explain portions of the code so that I can distinguish your personal understanding of the material.

- **Not Assessable (N)**: Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts.
- **Revision Needed (R)**: Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but there are significant gaps. Further review and improvements required. Program does not run or not all requirements are met. 
- **Acceptable (A)**: Understanding of the concepts is evident. Code compiles and runs without errors. All of the requirements are met.
- **Exemplary (E)**: Everything for A plus code is well-documented and follows all course style conventions. This work could be used as a classroom example.
